# ECE-211-Signal-Processing

Coursework for ECE 211 covering signals-and-systems foundations in time, frequency, and transform domains, with an emphasis on analytical derivations and MATLAB-based implementation.

## Course Topics
- Signal-space tools: inner products, orthogonal expansions, projections, Lp norms
- Linear algebra for signals: eigenanalysis, least-squares, SVD
- Frequency-domain concepts: phasors, complex baseband, line spectra
- Sampling and reconstruction: sampling, aliasing, imaging
- LTI systems: convolution, frequency response, transfer functions; Fourier, Laplace, and z-transforms
- Digital filtering: FIR/IIR design and analysis
- System behavior: block diagrams, stability, feedback, initial conditions, transients, damping; Bode plots
- State-space models: analog/digital state-space; transition and transfer function matrices
- Random signals: correlation matrices, Gaussian vectors/signals, white noise, stationarity, ergodicity, PSD, ARMA models
